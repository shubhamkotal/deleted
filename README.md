Aspect: Approach to Loss Allowance

IFRS 9 (IASB):
Utilizes a three-stage approach where lifetime expected credit losses are recognized only when credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition.

CECL (FASB):
Employs a two-stage approach where lifetime expected credit losses are recognized upfront for all loans.

Implications:
The main difference lies in the treatment of financial assets without a significant increase in credit risk. Under CECL, all loans incur lifetime expected credit losses upfront, whereas IFRS 9 recognizes lifetime expected credit losses only when there is a significant increase in credit risk.

Aspect: Relevant Time Horizons

IFRS 9 (IASB):
Utilizes a dual credit-loss measurement approach, measuring the loss allowance either as 12-month expected credit losses or lifetime expected credit losses based on the stage classification of the financial asset.

CECL (FASB):
Applies lifetime expected credit losses for all financial assets since the inception of the loan.

Implications:
The primary difference affects financial assets classified under Stage 1 in the ECL approach. IFRS 9 considers both 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses, while CECL recognizes lifetime expected credit losses for all financial assets.

Additional Similarity:

Scope:
Both IFRS 9 and CECL cover financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). However, under CECL, these assets are excluded unless there's a decline in fair value below amortized cost due to credit risk.

Treatment of Loan Commitments:
Both standards require measuring expected credit losses over the period of credit risk exposure. However, CECL does not allow recognition of an allowance beyond the point of unconditional cancellation, regardless of exercising the right.

Accrual of Interest Income:
For credit-impaired loans (stage 3), both standards adjust the interest rate based on expected credit losses. However, IFRS 9 applies it to the net amount of the loan after provisions, while CECL allows gross basis accruals.

Collective Evaluation:
While both standards permit collective evaluation of credit losses when similar risk characteristics exist, CECL mandates it when similarities are identified.

Time Value of Money:
Both standards consider the time value of money in calculating expected credit losses, either explicitly through discounted cash flows (IFRS 9) or implicitly through various accepted methods (CECL).

Forward-looking Information:
Both standards require considering reasonable and supportable information, including forward-looking information, in impairment assessments. However, CECL explicitly allows reverting to historical loss information when reasonable forecasts cannot be developed.

These similarities and differences highlight the nuanced approaches of IFRS 9 and CECL in addressing loss allowances, time horizons, and the treatment of various financial instruments.

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here's a summarized comparison of the five major similarities and differences between IFRS 9 and CECL:

Similarities:

Instruments in Scope for Impairment:
Both standards cover financial assets at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts, loan commitments, and certain other financial instruments.
Measurement Objectives:
Both standards aim to reflect management's best estimate of expected credit losses, considering past events, current conditions, and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.
Treatment for Undrawn Loan Commitments:
Both standards require estimating credit losses over the full contractual period for which the entity is exposed to credit risk, considering the likelihood of funding and expected losses on future funding.
Treatment for Renewable Loans:
Impairment must be calculated based on the contractual life of the loan, despite the possibility for renewal, under both standards.
Individual Loan Impairment Assessments:
Both standards allow for individual loan impairment assessments, which must be excluded from collective assessments if undertaken.
Differences:

Scope of Financial Instruments:
CECL includes collateral-dependent loans and financial assets with continuous adjustments to securing collateral, whereas IFRS 9 covers trade receivables with a significant financing component.
Treatment of Undrawn Loan Commitments:
CECL calculates the credit loss as the present value of the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows if the loan is drawn down, while IFRS 9 determines credit loss for undrawn commitments based on the present value of expected cash flows.
Practical Expedients:
CECL provides practical expedients for instrument stage classification and impairment modeling for available-for-sale (AFS) securities, while IFRS 9 offers simplified models for certain trade receivables.
Impairment Model:
CECL employs a lifetime expected credit loss (ECL) model for all instruments, whereas IFRS 9 uses a single impairment model with different stages based on credit quality deterioration.
Implementation Deadlines:
CECL's implementation deadline for SEC registrants was January 1, 2020, while for non-SEC registrants, it was January 1, 2021. IFRS 9 was implemented starting January 1, 2018, with varying early adoption options by country, and insurance companies had the option to defer until 2021.
These differences and similarities highlight the nuanced approaches and requirements of each standard in addressing impairment of financial instruments.

__________________________________________________________________________________________
Here are the summarized aspects of IFRS 9 and CECL along with their implications:

Approach to Loss Allowance:

IFRS 9 (IASB): Three-stage approach focusing on recognizing lifetime expected credit losses when credit risk significantly increases.
CECL (FASB): Two-stage approach recognizing lifetime expected credit losses upfront for all loans.
Implications:

IFRS 9 focuses on identifying significant increases in credit risk, while CECL recognizes expected credit losses upfront for all loans, potentially leading to higher initial allowances under CECL.
Relevant Time Horizons:

IFRS 9 (IASB): Utilizes a dual credit-loss measurement approach based on the stage classification of financial assets.
CECL (FASB): Applies lifetime expected credit losses for all financial assets since the inception of the loan.
Implications:

The main difference lies in how financial assets without a significant increase in credit risk are treated, impacting the timing and amount of credit loss recognition.
Scope:

IFRS 9 (IASB): Covers financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI).
CECL (FASB): Excludes FVOCI assets unless their fair value declines below amortized cost due to credit risk.
Implications:

This difference affects the treatment of certain debt securities, potentially leading to different impairment outcomes.
Treatment of Loan Commitments:

Both standards measure expected credit losses over the exposure period, but CECL doesn't allow recognition beyond the point of unconditional cancellation.
Implications:

This difference may affect the timing and amount of impairment recognition for loan commitments.
Accrual of Interest Income:

IFRS 9 adjusts interest rates for credit-impaired loans, while CECL allows gross basis accruals.
Implications:

Different approaches may impact income recognition and financial statement presentation.
Collective Evaluation:

Both standards permit collective evaluation when similar risk characteristics exist, with CECL mandating it under certain conditions.
Implications:

CECL's requirement for collective evaluation may lead to more consistent impairment assessments.
Time Value of Money:

Both standards consider the time value of money in calculating expected credit losses, using various methods.
Implications:

The approaches may result in different allowance amounts, affecting financial statement presentation.
Forward-looking Information:

Both standards require considering forward-looking information, with CECL allowing the use of historical loss information when reasonable forecasts are not possible.
Implications:

The standards' treatment of forward-looking information may impact the accuracy of impairment estimates.
These summaries outline the key differences and implications of IFRS 9 and CECL in the context of loss allowance, relevant time horizons, scope, treatment of loan commitments, accrual of interest income, collective evaluation, time value of money, and forward-looking information.
